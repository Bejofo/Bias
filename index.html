        We have too many patients for the doctors to diagnose, and we need to quick way to determine who is sick or not.
        <br>
        By plotting previous patient data, we hope to find quick way to predict who is infected or not.
        <br>
        Your goal is to draw a line that best seperates the infected (red) from the not infected (green).
        <br>
        Draw a line by <b>clicking and draging  left to right</b>. Don't try right to left. I haven't fixed that yet.
        <br>
        Don't worry too much about getting it perfect, we just a need a high enough accuracy, aim for 90%.
        <br>
        If you don't like your line, you can reset it just by drawing another line.

      <h1>What is the point of this???</h1>

      <h2>How does have anything to do with machine learning?</h2>
      The process of drawing a seperating line is pretty much what most of machine learning boils down to. Of course the computer can do this faster and better than you,
      but you get the idea.

      <h2>Bias</h2>
      If you experiment and draw the lines a couple of different times, you can see that you will pretty consistently have better accuracy rates for
      square patients. This isn't because you are secretly racist against triangle patients (are you? ಠ_ಠ) but it's an artifact of how triangle patients 
      are a minority. In this case, the triangle patients follow a different pattern than the sqaures patients, but that can be hard to see because
      of the square's majority.

      <h2>The question of fairness</h2>
      There is endless amount of literature debating what it means to be fair. Being fair is subjective, and hard to define.
      In this demostration here, is it ok to misclassify more triangle patients for a better overall accuracy? 
      If we allowed to model to discriminate by race, it's possible to get high accuracy for both triangles and squares. Is this ok? 
      Or should race never be a consideration in medical descions?

      I may have bitten off more than I can chew. Which is why this site looks so ugly.
